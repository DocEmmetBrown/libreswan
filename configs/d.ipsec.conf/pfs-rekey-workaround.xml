      Force the re-negotiation of the Child SAs full crypto suite
      during an IKEv2 rekey exchange.
    </para>
    <para>
      Normally, during a rekey, pluto will only re-negotiate the
      crypto suite (encryption, integrity, Diffie-Hellman) that was
      agreed when the Child SA established.  For a Child SA created
      during IKE_AUTH which has only negotiated encryption and
      integrity and perfect forward privacy (<emphasis
      remap='B'>pfs=yes</emphasis>) is required and <emphasis
      remap='B'>esp=</emphasis> does not specify Diffie-Hellman
      groups, the re-key proposal will include the IKE SA's
      Diffie-Hellman group (if <emphasis remap='B'>esp=</emphasis>
      does specify Diffie-Hellman groups then it is used for the
      initial rekey of the IKE_AUTH Child SA).
    </para>
    <para>
      Setting <emphasis remap='B'>pfs-rekey-workaround=yes</emphasis>
      forces pluto to always re-negotiate the full set of proposals
      specified by <emphasis remap='B'>esp=</emphasis> during the
      rekey.  perfect forward privacy (<emphasis
      remap='B'>pfs=yes</emphasis>) is required and <emphasis
      remap='B'>esp=</emphasis> does not specify Diffie-Hellman
      groups, IKE SA's Diffie-Hellman group will be added.
    </para>
    <para>
      The accepted values are <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>, (the
      default) or <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>.
