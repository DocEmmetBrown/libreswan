  <listitem>
  <para>how many bytes can be sent/received on the inbound or outbound SA of a particular instance of a connection
(a set of encryption/authentication keys for user packets) ,
from successful negotiation to expiry;
acceptable values are an integer optionally followed by
  <emphasis remap='B'>KiB</emphasis>,
  <emphasis remap='B'>MiB</emphasis>,
  <emphasis remap='B'>GiB</emphasis>,
  <emphasis remap='B'>TiB</emphasis>,
  <emphasis remap='B'>PiB</emphasis> or
  <emphasis remap='B'>EiB</emphasis> to signify kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
  terabytes, petabytes or exabytes. The default is 2^63 bytes.

Normally, the connection is renegotiated (via the IKE SA) before ipsec-max-bytes value is reached.
This option is not negotiated and both ends use their own value for this option.

<para>
	The value set two triggers. The number of bytes allowed to be encrypted with the same key, ie hard expire
        and a soft limit. The soft limit is 50% of ipsec-max-bytes + random value derived using rekeyfuzz that will
	slightly prefer an initiator over a responder so that hopefully the original initiator will keep initiating.
	An IPsec SA contains two keys, a key for inbound and outbound traffic. Thus a value of 1GiB means a rekey is
	triggered when either inbound or outbound traffic hits the configured value. These values are not added up.
