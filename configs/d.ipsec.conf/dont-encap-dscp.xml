Disable encapsulating the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP, formerly
known as Terms Of Service (TOS)) bits. The extra flag "dont-encap-dscp" prevents
these bits from being copied from the unencrypted IP packets to the encrypted
IP packets.
Acceptable values are
<emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) or <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>.
Currently this feature is only implemented for the Linux XFRM stack.
