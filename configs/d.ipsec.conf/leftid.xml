      how the left participant should be identified for
      authentication; defaults to <emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>.
      Can be an IP address or a fully-qualified domain name which will
      be resolved.  If preceded by <emphasis remap='B'>@</emphasis>,
      the value is used as a literal string and will not be resolved.

      To support opaque identifiers (usually of type ID_KEY_ID, such
      as used by Cisco to specify Group Name, use square brackets, eg
      <emphasis remap='B'>rightid=@[GroupName]</emphasis>.

      The magic value <emphasis remap='B'>%fromcert</emphasis> causes
      the ID to be set to a DN taken from a certificate that is
      loaded.  Prior to 2.5.16, this was the default if a certificate
      was specified.

      The magic value <emphasis remap='B'>%none</emphasis> sets the ID
      to no ID. This is included for completeness, as the ID may have
      been set in the default conn, and one wishes for it to default
      instead of being explicitly set.

    <para>
      When using certificate based ID's, one need to specify the full
      RDN, optionally using wildcard matching (eg CN='*'). If the RDN
      contains a comma, this can be masked using a comma (eg OU='Foo,,
      Bar and associates')
