This is an IKEv2 and IKEv1 test. Two connections between the same end points road-east. One with ikev=insist and the other keyexchange=ikev1. It use X509 certs on the initiator (road), and on the responder(east).

If the connections get added and brought up as in the scripts,
it is observed that conn with keyexchange=ikev2 get established with ikev1.

if we change the order of add and up there will be two connections.

NOTE: So shouldn't this test show a failure to fix in code?
