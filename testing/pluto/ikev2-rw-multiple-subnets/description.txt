IKEv2 RW with subnets, using auto=start

this shows on east:

|    match_id a=C=CA, ST=Ontario, L=Toronto, O=Libreswan, OU=Test Department, CN=road.testing.libreswan.org, E=user-road@testing.libreswan.org
|             b=%fromcert
|    results  fail
|     connection "east/0x2" does not match IDs or CA of current connection "east/0x1"

Clearly, this is wrong, as both connections are instantiated and are identical in IKE SA params
