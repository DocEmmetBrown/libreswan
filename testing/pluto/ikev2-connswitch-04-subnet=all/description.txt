test connection selection when subnet=0.0.0.0/

(not technically connection swiching but related)

East loads two connections:

      conn distraction
      	   policy-label=system_u:object_r:ipsec_spd_t:s0
      	   auto=add
      conn west-to-east
      	   also=distraction

when west connects, east should choose west-to-east.
It instead chooses distraction.

Some additional distractions:

    policy-label=system_u:object_r:ipsec_spd_t:s0

         this prevents the child exchange which, through, traffic
         selectors, would let the responder (east) figure out its
         mistake

    the add order on east matters

	 adding west-to-east then distraction shows the problem yet
	 distraction then west-to-east does not
