Configure EAST so that it will interop with an android simulator using x509

The android simulator needs to be given west.p12 (password foobar)
found in (testing/x509/p12/mainca/west.p12).  See:
   View > Tool Windows > Device File Explorer

DO NOT SET KVM_PREFIXES: EAST needs to be directly accessable from the
host.

On the host:
    ./kvm install check testing/pluto/android-be-happy
    ./kvm sh east
    east# tail -f /tmp/pluto.log
On the android simulator, configure:
    type: IKEv2/IPsec RSA
    server: 192.1.2.23
    identifier: west
    IPsec user certificate: west (see above)
    IPsec CA certificate: (don't verify server)
    IPsec server certificate: (received from server)

Known bugs:

   Android's IKE crashes with aes-gcm+rsa
   https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/203676760

   Android proposes DIGSIG sha1+sha2 hashes; pluto accepts only sha2;
   android ignores this and uses a sha1 hash when signing.
   https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/213617220

   Android shouldn't be sending a delete IKE SA request when it gets
   back an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED IKE_AUTH response
