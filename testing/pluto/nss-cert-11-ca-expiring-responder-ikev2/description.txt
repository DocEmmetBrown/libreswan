old expiring CA overlapping a new CA with random connection order

East has two connections:

  old-east: with old-ca that expires in a month, it uses that to sign
  old-west

  new-east: with new-ca that has a very long expiry, it uses that to
  sign new-west

West similarly has two connections:

  old-west: tries to prove its identity using old-west certificate
  (i.e., to the connection old-east)

  new-west: tries to prove its identity using new-west certificate
  (i.e., to the connection new-east)

Since all CAs and certs are valid old-west and new-west should always
establish.

To that end, east's connections are added old,new and then new,old.
West then tries to establish.
