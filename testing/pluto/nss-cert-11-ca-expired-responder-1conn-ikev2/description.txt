old expired CA overlapping a new CA using template connections

(using templates avoids bug #1006 where the CA doesn't switch with
<peer>id=%fromcert)

East has one template connection with <peer>id=%fromcert and:

  old-ca that expires in a month, it uses that to sign old-west

  new-ca that has a very long expiry, it uses that to sign new-west

West similarly has two connections:

  old-west: tries to prove its identity using old-west certificate
  (i.e., to the connection old-east)

  new-west: tries to prove its identity using new-west certificate
  (i.e., to the connection new-east)

Since all CAs and certs are valid old-west and new-west should always
establish.
